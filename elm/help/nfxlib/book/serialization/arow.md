# Arow 

Adaptive Row (Arow) - code generator produces C# code that serializes and de-serializes object 
instances derived form `TypedRow`. The Arow serializer is very efficient as it avoids boxing and
making transitive copies. The Arow serializer does not support polymorphism and only allows for the
following types:

* CLR Primitives
* Nullable CLR Primitives
* Guid, GDID, Amount  NFX structs
* Types derived directly or indirectly from TypedRow
* List or arrays of the aforementioned types

The Arow serializer only processes properties decorated with `[Field]` attribute having 
`isArow: true` property. The `backendName` has to be 1-8 ASCII-only chars, so the field names are
written using compressed ULONG format for efficiency (strings are much less efficient because they 
are reference types and require GC). Arow binds rows by name, consequently Arow is a Version-tolerant
serializer. 

The performance of Arow is akin to the fastest binary serializers in CLR (.NET Core or full) due to C# code which gets emitted for every type and avoidance of boxing and string instances for field names (similar approach is used in Protobuf et. al.)

The serialization/deserialization cores get generated by the command line tool - [arow](/tools/arow.html).
