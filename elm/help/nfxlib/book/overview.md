# Overview

<br>

**NFX** contains numerous features some of which will be briefly described below. 
It is a great solution for almost all tasks that can occur during development process, 
but we believe that one of the main feature of **NFX** framework is unification of libraries and processes that obviates the need to use package managers with many 3rd party libraries. 
Really impressive results can be achieved by using **NFX** Glue and Wave web components. 
The first allows to develop extremely fast service-oriented applications while the latter is a powerful web server solution for developing fast and secure web applications.

The primary purpose of this framework is this: small code base and absence of dependencies on 3rd parties (i.e. Protobuf, Nlog, Newtonsoft etc.). 
It is worth noting that **NFX** is not a PURIST framework, instead it is a practical tool for real-life problem solving.


## Why NFX?

**NFX** provides a bunch of extremely efficient features for building Web- or desktop applications of any complexity and load/performance requirements
such as

* Unified configuration paradigm

* Ultrafast end efficient serialization

* Storing extremely large number of CLR objects (up to a hundreds of millions) in memory via **NFX** Pile concept 
based on **NFX** serialization

* Effective caching based on **NFX** serialization

* Support of different non-homogeneous data stores with hybrid approach to application data access

* Glue - An out-of-the-box service-oriented technology for building distributed computing systems

* WAVE technology for building MVC/No MVC Web applications with out-of-the-box Web server and handy HTML templatization engine

* Extremely fast MongoDB connector


## What NFX is good for?

* Building high-load Web applications 

* Building of distributed applications

* Using of any individual parts of the framework (i.e. serilization, configuration etc.) in existing legacy applications
