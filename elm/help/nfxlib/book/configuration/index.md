# Configuration

Configuration is a very important part of all **NFX**-based applications. 
**NFX** configuration paradigm allows to store and use custom variables in configurations file, resolve system environment variables, 
perform merging and overriding whole config sections and even includes handy scripting engine. 
Configuration can be stored and read from file in local file system, database, SVN, Google Drive or any other abstract file system 
(which is also available in **NFX** - see [File Systems](./../filesystem/index.md)).
